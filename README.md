# MVP Timer

Timer list to track kills and respawns of MVPs in the MMORPG Ragnarok Online. Built using React, Electron, and PouchDB.

### Installation

This repository only contains the source code for the project. To install the dependencies needed to run the program, use `npm install` or `yarn install` depending on your preferred package manager. The source code can also be added to an electron binary package to run as a standalone program.

### Usage

Using the program is fairly straightforward. The main screen consists of a list of active timers. If no timers exist, a new one can be created with the **New Timer** button. Search for an MVP by name using the search bar. Select the map, kill position, and kill time. A timer will be created. Clicking on the map will place a marker to show where the MVP was killed.
